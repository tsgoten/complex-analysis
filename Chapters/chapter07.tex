\chapter{Application of Residues}
We turn now to some important applications of the theory of residues, which was
developed in the previous chapter. 
\section{Evaluation of Improper Integrals}
In calculus, the improper integral of a continuous function $ f(x) $ over the semiinfinite interval $ 0 \leq x < \infty $ is defined by means of the equation 
\[ \int_{0}^{\infty} f(x)dx = \lim\lim\limits_{R \rightarrow \infty} \int_{0}^{R} f(x) dx \]

\section{Improper Integrals From Fourier Analysis}
Residue theory can be useful in evaluating convergent improper integrals of the form of trig identities 
\[ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \sin ax dx \]
\[ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \cos ax dx \]
